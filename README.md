# Travel API

## by Kaila Goff and Ron Craig

## Description
### Building a travel API reviewing various travel destinations around the world.  Will use request specs to test all routes and exceptions.

## User Stories
- [ ] As a user, I want to GET and POST reviews about travel destinations.
- [ ] As a user, I want to GET reviews by country or city.
- [ ] As a user, I want to see the most popular travel destinations by number of reviews or by overall rating.
- [ ] As a user, I want to PUT and DELETE reviews, but only if I wrote them. (Start by requiring a user_name param to match the user_name of the author on the message. You can always try authentication later.)
- [ ] As a user, I want to look up random destinations just for fun.


### API build instructions (assuming Mac OS)
* Clone repository and move to the home repository folder `Computer:travel_api user$`.
* Run `$ gem install rails`.
* Verify that you are using ruby-2.4.1 in your terminal(s).
* Run `$ bundle install` to install Ruby gems packages related to the Gemfile in the top level.
* Rspec setup (Unit Testing and Models): In the terminal, run the following command `$ bundle exec rails generate rspec:install`. Files will be generated in the spec folder. In the home repository folder run `$ rspec` to view tests passing or failing.
* Database setup: Run `$ rake db:create` to generate a database. Run `$ rails generate migration action_name` generate a migration file for table manipulation. After generating the necessary tables, run `$ rake db:migrate` to prepare the database. Run `$ rake db:test:prepare` to create the Active Record schema.rb file. To run a seed to populate a database, run `$ rake db:seed`.
* Rails server: Run `$ rails server` to start the Rails server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Refresh the page to reload any changes to the source files.
